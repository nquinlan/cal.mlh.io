# Major League Hacking Calendar

This essentially scrapes events on [mlh.io](http://mlh.io) and converts the data directly into a `.ical` format. It detects your location to show only local events (UK subscribers won't receive information on US events) but entering `cal.mlh.io/:region` (i.e `us`) can override this.

There are two ways you can interact with MLH Calendar:
- Enter `cal.mlh.io` on your browser to view all events and add individually.
- Subscribe to `cal.mlh.io` to automatically have the events on your Calendar.

## Fork it, hack it and improve it!
We've open sourced the guts behind the MLH Calendar, which is built using Ruby/Sinatra. If you already have Ruby and Git installed, it's as simple as:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mlh/cal.mlh.io.git
$ cd cal.mlh.io
$ bundle install
$ rackup
```

Your contributions would be very welcomed.
